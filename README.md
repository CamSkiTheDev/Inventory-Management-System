ðŸ’» All help is welcome... Don't be afraid to submit a PR ðŸ˜œ

#### Barcode Intigration

I would like to add barcode intigration to give the user the ability to add/search, new/existing inventory via a items barcode image (Device Camera).

I would also like to add the ability to create 2D and 3D barcodes for items and send them to a bluetooth/network printer.

#### React & React-Navtive Client & NodeJS Backend

I would also like to refactor the app into a dedicated nodejs backend. That way I can have multipule applicitation clients. I would like to build the clients with React and React Native.

#### Self Hosted & Open Source

Stocky will always be open source and availabe to be self hosted. Spin up a copy of <img height="12" src="https://stocky-imt.herokuapp.com/stocky_logo.svg" /> Stocky today!
